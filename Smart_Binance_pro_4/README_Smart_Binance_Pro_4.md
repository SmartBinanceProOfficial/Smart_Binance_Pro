üõ†Ô∏è Code Explanation

Solidity Version: ^0.8.20, leveraging modern Solidity for security and efficiency.
Key Components:
Node Structure (via SBPLibrary): Tracks user data (id, left/rightReferralCode, plus/proInvestment, totalLeft/RightCount, addressChangeCount, plus/pro/weeklyLeft/Right) for a robust binary tree.
Constructor: Initializes with BUSD (0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955) as the default token, sets the contract creator as "God," and configures referral codes.
Core Functions:
registerUSDT/registerSBP: Users join by paying 100 USDT or 1000 SBP, integrating into the binary tree with automatic airdrops (1000/1500 SBP for Plus/Pro).
upgradeProUSDT/upgradeProSBP: Upgrades users to Pro tier (150 USDT or 1500 SBP), unlocking higher rewards.
distributeHourlyPoints: Allocates rewards every 35 minutes based on points (capped at 5), with 90% of the pool distributed and 5% added to liquidity.
distributeWeeklyPoints: Distributes weekly rewards for Pro users (capped at 10 points), enhancing long-term engagement.
changeWalletAddress: Allows secure address changes (max 3 times) with wallet redirection.
batchImportUsers/exportUserData: Seamlessly migrates users from previous contracts via smartbinance.pro within 3 business days.
withdrawReward/withdrawSbp: Enables secure reward withdrawals with DAO approval for large amounts.
writeIpfs: Stores metadata for transparency and extensibility.


Utility Functions: Provide detailed user info (getMyFullInfo, getMyReferralCodes) for transparency.



üéØ Key Features

SBP Token with Locked Balances: Tokens are locked for one year to ensure stability, with 5% of registration fees added to liquidity, guaranteeing profitable sales post-release (as per SBP Token Whitepaper).
DAO Governance: The SbpControllerDAO contract requires 1,000 votes over 7 days for withdrawals, ensuring no single entity (including "God") can manipulate funds.
Pro Membership: Users can upgrade to Pro (150 USDT/SBP) for higher point caps and rewards, enhancing earning potential.
Buy-Back Mechanism: Users can request a 100 USDT refund within 15 days via smartbinance.pro, with authorized wallets registered by "God."
Secure Imports: Unlike previous forks, imported structures don‚Äôt generate points or drain pools, preventing fake user exploits.
Zero Gas Fees: All calculations are system-driven, eliminating gas costs for users.
AI-Powered Ecosystem: Free one-year AI services and educational resources, aligning with global AI and crypto goals.
User-Friendly UI: Access via smart.smartbinance.pro and @SmartBinanceProRobot for seamless interaction.
Mature Platform: After three years of refinement, Smart_Binance_Pro_4 is the final, fully developed contract with a professional team and clear roadmap.
Community-Driven Pools: Designed to build a strong community through transparent reward distribution and incentives.
