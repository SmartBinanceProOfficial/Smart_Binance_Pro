Smart Binance Pro 3 - Advanced Binary Network Contract
Project Overview
Smart_Binance_Pro_3 (fork3.sol) is the third iteration in the Smart Binary series, forked from Smart_Binance_Pro_2. It introduces advanced features like a max-point purchase option, dynamic reward timing, and stricter access controls to enhance security and user engagement. The project continues the vision of building a community-driven, tokenized binary network, encouraging participation through rewards and referrals. This contract is a step toward a more secure and flexible system, open for community contributions to refine and scale.
Evolution from Previous Forks
Smart_Binance_Pro_3 builds on Smart_Binary, Smart_Binance_Pro, and Smart_Binance_Pro_2 by:

Adding Max_Point to allow users to pay 200 BUSD for enhanced point caps (10 vs. 5).
Introducing dynamic reward timing (1 or 2 hours, configurable by operator).
Enhancing lottery restrictions (max 18 attempts, 9-point side limit).
Adding contract detection (I_C) to prevent non-wallet interactions.
Implementing a 12-hour buy-back mechanism.
Streamlining data migration from Smart_Binance_Pro_2.

Code Explanation

Solidity Version: >=0.4.22 <0.9.0
Key Components:
Node Structure: Adds FF (max-point flag) to track enhanced point status.
Constructor: Initializes BUSD (0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955), SBT3 token, operator, and Smart_Binance_Pro_2 for migration.
Core Functions:
Register: Users pay 100 BUSD to join, with contract detection.
Max_Point: Users pay 200 BUSD to increase point cap to 10 (one-time).
Reward: Distributes rewards every 1-2 hours, adjusting for max-point users.
Smart_Gift: Lottery for zero-point users (guess 1-3, win 5 BUSD, max 18 attempts).
_Import_Fast and _Import_OPT: Migrate users from Smart_Binance_Pro_2.
_Dont_Change_My_Address and _Change_My_Address: Address change (max 3 times) with stricter checks.
Smart_Air_Drop: Distributes SBT3 tokens (100 to 10K, max 3 times).
_Bonus_For_100: Operator distributes 100 SBT3 to users with 100+ points.
_Buy_Back_12: Redistributes 90 BUSD every 12 hours.


Utility Functions: Enhanced for transparency and user data access.



Features

Dynamic reward timing (1-2 hours).
Max-point purchase for higher rewards.
Stricter lottery rules for fairness.
Contract detection to block non-wallet calls.
12-hour buy-back mechanism.
Address change with improved validation.
Tiered air-drop and bonus systems.

Known Issues and Vulnerabilities

Fraud Risks:

Operator Overreach: _Buy_Back_12, _Bonus_For_100, and _Add_Change_Address allow operator control, risking manipulation.
Random Number Generation: Still uses manipulable block.timestamp and block.prevrandao.
Weak Validation: _Change_My_Address and _Import_OPT could be exploited if not carefully managed.


Excessive Developer Freedom:

Operators can set reward fees, timing, and bank addresses without governance.
No multi-signature mechanisms.


Code Quality Issues:

Obfuscated variable names persist.
Hardcoded values (e.g., 200 BUSD, 90 BUSD) limit adaptability.
Gas-intensive loops in ZB and Reward.
Missing events for key actions.


Scalability Concerns:

On-chain storage remains costly.
Fixed fees may not scale with network size.


Security Oversights:

No reentrancy guards.
Dependency on Smart_Binance_Pro_2 introduces risks.



Community Vision
Smart_Binance_Pro_3 advances the binary network with enhanced features and security. We invite the community to contribute by addressing vulnerabilities, improving scalability, and proposing innovative features to create a robust ecosystem.
